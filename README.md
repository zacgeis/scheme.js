SICP.JS
====================

Intro
=====
The goal of this project is to create a Scheme implementation that supports working through all of the SICP excersises.  The interpreter is implemented in JavaScript allowing it to be easily available to anyone with a browser.  Eventually, I'd like to build out an entire browser based interative development environment.

Roadmap

_In Progress_ - To get a feel of the current progress, checkout spec/EvaluatorSpec.js.
